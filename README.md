# project

## statement
This data visualisations will create a bigger awareness of the afterlife of our trash and how many trash we produce in Europe.
The target group is everyone living in Europe with access to the internet.

## solution
Bigger awareness will be created by showing how many trash we produce per person per year. This will be expressed in plastic bottles. You can see how much of your trash is recycled, how much ends up in landfill, is decomposted, burned.
